<h3>blank_mbr</h3>
<p>Looking for a quick way to nuke a partition table from a machine?  You've
found one here!</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>Burn the ISO or create a bootable USB flash drive with syslinux, then use
the <em>vmlinuz</em> Linux kernel and <em>initramfs</em> image to boot up the
system, specifiying a drive to blank the master boot record on.  Example
syslinux/isolinux command line:

<p><code>blank blankdev=/dev/some/device</code>

<p>Remember kids, this ISO/initramfs image will wipe the first 20M of the
drive (using the command listed at [1]), so if you have data on there that you
wanted to save, good luck getting it back!  

<p>Actually, getting your data back should be pretty easy, but it will just
take a while, you would have to recreate the partition table, or send the disk
out to a recovery service and have them fetch the data for you.

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
