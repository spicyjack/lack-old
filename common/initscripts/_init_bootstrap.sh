# System bootstrapping script for stand-alone systems, i.e. you will
# switch_root and exec /sbin/init in the new root partition.
#
# This script will
# 1) boot the system
# 2) Run the symlinked scripts in /etc/boot in SYSV init order
# 3) The scripts in /etc/boot are supposed to do things like mount encrypted
# volumes or mount the root partition from an LVM volume (if LVM volume is
# passed in from /proc/cmdline)
# 4) The call to switch_root that is run at the end of this script should
# transfer control to the /sbin/init binary found on that freshly-mounted
# filesystem.

# begin busybox setup; from here on down, you need to use the full path to
# busybox, along with the name of the module you want to run, as the busybox
# symlinks don't exist (yet)

# also, if you add binaries to the image that would live in the same place as a
# busybox applet (example, losetup binary and losetup busybox applet), then you
# need to use the full path to the binary in any script called from here, as
# the busybox applet will be run if there is no path to the binary

# TODO
# - detect if the script output is going to a serial console or not, and adjust
# calls to colorize() accordingly
# - create a script parameter called $LOG_COMMAND, and have $LOG_COMMAND be
# either the 'tee' command or a cat command; this will allow the script to
# print the command output to the screen or a logfile and the screen at the
# same time

# connected to serial console can see what's happening
