# System bootstrapping script for systems that will use busybox's init script
# to run the system, i.e. some sort of embedded system.
#
# This script will:
# 1) boot the system
# 2) Run the symlinked scripts in /etc/boot in SYSV init order
# 3) Exec busybox init, which will transfer control to busybox's init daemon,
# which should then parse the busybox formatted /etc/inittab and run other
# programs as appropriate

# begin busybox setup; from here on down, you need to use the full path to
# busybox, along with the name of the module you want to run, as the busybox
# symlinks don't exist (yet)

# also, if you add binaries to the image that would live in the same place as a
# busybox applet (example, losetup binary and losetup busybox applet), then you
# need to use the full path to the binary in any script called from here, as
# the busybox applet will be run if there is no path to the binary

# TODO
# - detect if the script output is going to a serial console or not, and adjust
# calls to colorize() accordingly
# - create a script parameter called $LOG_COMMAND, and have $LOG_COMMAND be
# either the 'tee' command or a cat command; this will allow the script to
# print the command output to the screen or a logfile and the screen at the
# same time
